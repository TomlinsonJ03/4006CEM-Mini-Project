        And then I, the stranger and in this case – a really well know theft, saw him: this big, in form of a square, metallic and crusty orange robot. He is the second AI of the house … \n
        “I am aware that I am eccentric. I am aware that I am always over the top. I am aware that I am too sassy for the other 4 AI robots.” the robot said. “But that’s me – the babysitter & teacher of this big, luxurious house.” \n
        “Oh wow” I replied. “You really seem to be so happy about things around you. Are you always this cheerful about things surrounding you?” \n
        The AI replied: “It’s such a pity that I can’t feel anything; that I don’t have emotions … Because if I was asked my opinion on the humankind, I would have never ended talking and complaining.”\n
        “Let me hear it” I exclaimed. \n
        “I’ll tell you”, the AI replied, “how I feel about this buffoonery:\n
        As a babysitter, every single one of the AI robots and family members of this house underestimates my abilities. I don’t think that they even know how HARD it is for me to change diapers, to stop babies from crying all day, or to clean the room after these little hedgehogs play in the living room. UHHH … And the most frustrating part is that it’s the second time this week when the mother of these babies forgot to put milk in my reservoir … How am I supposed to breastfeed the babies?!?!” \n
        I was getting on my nerves. I really am not able to stand this AI … I have to take a decision: 
        1. I let the AI robot talk his feelings out so it is easier for me to get to the kids’ room and steal the money from the secret chamber
        2. I try to hack the AI because I am bored of his crap. My aim is, after all, get the money from the secret chamber as soon as possible.

        “And please, don’t even get me started on the fact that I’m the teacher of this penthouse.” said the AI while walking towards the kids’ room. I was following him. “The other day, Moji, the intelligent AI, told me that babies are too young to learn about binary … 01010111 01101000 01100001 01110100 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01000110 00100011 01000011 01001011!!!! See what I did there? … Do you know binary? Of course not. You won’t know what I wrote here because you didn’t learn binary as a kid. I for sure know that if they learned Python from the age of 2, they wouldn’t have issues at Uni as some of the students have nowadays …” Luckily for me, the robot runs out of energy. The AI needs to be charged. In that time, I quickly leave the AI alone, go in the secret chamber and get all the money. After that, without anyone noticing, I plug the AI to the charging spot and walk away with all the cash.

# Hack AI
def hackAI():

      “Oh, my lord!” I exclaimed. “Can you shut your f-ing mouth already?”
      “Aghhhh … Do you kiss your mother with those lips?” says the AI intrigued, as he was thinking that I am his friend.
      “Lemme hack you … once and for ALL!!! I just cannot stand you anymore!” I speak.
      I try to disconnect the AI from the network, but fail miserably. Upcoming, I try to hit his motherboard. This process fails as well, as the robot moves away quickly from me. One of the kids wakes up and approaches the fight. By that time, I somehow recognise his face and remember that I have seen him in a documentary about famous, already filthy rich babies. I then remember where the kids’ room is and run in that direction, as the room leads to the secret chamber where all the money is.
      “NOT ON MY WATCH!” the AI yells. “Activating self-destruct sequence!”   
      Then the AI produces a small bomb. The kid runs fast enough to his room to save himself, but I don’t have this time. I, along the second AI -the hero of this story, die in this little room. The robot speaks up his last words: “Looks like another victory, just a little longer!”.
