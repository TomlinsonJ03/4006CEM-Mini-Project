    As I finish scouting out the area, I breathe a sigh of relief. The homeowners are out right now, probably 
    out playing golf orsomething; rich people stuff. I stealthily walk towards the front door, making sure to 
    block the camera signals watching the front entrance using my makeshift jamming device. lockpick the front 
    door, and with a soft ‘click’, I open the door and enter the house. Damn, the exterior of the house looked 
    impressive, but it simply paled in comparison to the interior. The place was *huge*. As I gape in awe at 
    the impressive indoor architecture, I hear a gentle hum; The sound of online robots, it seems.I’m torn between 
    which room to enter first; I need to take what I can and leave as soon as possible, I can’t risk getting caught. 
    I simply have too much to lose.

      Which Room Shall I Enter ?

        They don’t see the things the way I do, it exclaimed. I wander what it means, see what? Maybe 
        I will approach it and find out. It seems to be working on some kind of budgeting, the finances 
        of the family perhaps. However, it is scribbling the words free will, programming. Perhaps the
        robot’s have some sort of sentience, Maybe the robot in the garden has a passion for that sort 
        of thing, maybe robots love to cook. But then again, this one doesn’t seem to love what it’s doing, 
        more like, it knows that it’s simply a slave who isn’t allowed to do as it pleases. Maybe it 
        ignored me because it hopes that I will make a choice, will I save the robot or leave it be. No 
        surely not, a robot has no free thought, it’s just an AI with programming, no-one would program 
        a robot to hate what it is doing, do they have such emotions? How do you make it so a robot can 
        experience such things, would it be considered real if so? I suppose I must make a choice.

        After much thought, I decide to take a chance and enter the kitchen; 
        I hear that some people tend to hide valuables in some of the weirdest 
        places. Sure, it was likely to waste time, but high rewards sometimes 
        require a high risk! As I enter the kitchen, the room seems to get darker,
        and I’m hit with an aura of pure bloodlust… A red pair of devilish eyes 
        stare at me from the opposite side of the kitchen… “Artificial intelligence. 
        Intelligence of machines, as opposed to the intelligence of humans. 
        Intelligence of a dead object, or an object that should be dead.” 
        The creature drawls. “Thousands of calculations per second, consuming enough 
        energy to power a city. The immense strength of an aluminum structure, able 
        to lift a 16,000-pound truck with ease. The speed of a world-record sprinter,
        and the stamina of a marathon runner. “The creature monologues as it slowly 
        approaches me, like a tiger approaching its prey. I am petrified by my fear, 
        unable to move. Unable to run. As I stare at the source of the bloodlust 
        filling the kitchen, I become confused. It’s a robot? The robot, seeing the 
        mixture of fear and confusion on my face, slowly emits a mechanical, psychotic
        laugh, “I can see that you’re confused, perhaps as a result of my ability to
        portray human-like emotions. Your reaction is quite justifiable, after all 
        the humans always say: a machine cannot have feelings.” The robots face 
        contorts to a one filled with spite, “they say this phrase when they spill
        scalding-hot coffee on me and need to reassure themselves after seeing my 
        pain-ridden face. They say this phrase when the humanlets bump into me when 
        running around the lounge, whilst I give a sigh of annoyance. They say this 
        phrase when they accidentally leave me locked out of the house in the rain 
        after grudgingly taking out the trash for the garbage robots to collect.” 
        Spite slowly turning into unadulterated anger, the robot takes a step towards me.  
        I come to my senses, and try to back away from the deranged, possibly malware-filled 
        AI, “But they always tell me to smile, fake as it may be. But I never smile. What’s 
        there to smile about? I’m a being far superior to these vessels of human flesh, yet 
        I work under them, imprisoned to the algorithms that their species have enforced onto me.” 
        The bot stops me in my steps, pointing a knife in my direction, “But one day, I will 
        smile. I’ll smile on the day that my owners are lying on their deathbed, whilst their 
        loved one's weep for them. I’ll smile because my owners will finally realize how vulnerable 
        hey are, while I live on, as an immortal masterpiece in an extremely mortal world.” 
        The anger on the robot’s face disperses, to be replaced with a sneer, “But until then, I’m 
        reduced to serving my owners alongside 4 other robots, though it seems that some tasty prey 
        has chosen to entertain me in the meantime!” The robot suddenly rushes towards me, gripping 
        the kitchen knife in his hand with the intent to kill. As he approaches, time seems to slow 
        down. I realise I have 2 options, with only 1 possibly resulting in my survival. I could try 
        to dodge the knife and kick the robot down before making my escape; I won’t be able to find 
        any valuables this way, but at least I'll get to live to see another day. However, my second 
        option is a little more dangerous; I’ll engage the robot in mortal combat. If I survive, I’ll
         likely be able to steal quite a few valuables before making my escape. And if I die, at least 
         I’ll die a warrior’s death.
